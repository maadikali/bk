Introduction: The 'BookStore' site allows the user to search for many free books online and read them without any difficulty. It uses NodeJS application software, which turns JavaScript from a highly specialized language into a general-purpose language. All the results are displayed in '.html' and '.ejs' files on the WEB page. Books are retrieved from the Google Books API. The site has registration and login, which makes it more convenient to use. After all, you can save your favorite books in a list and easily find them on your account page without wasting time searching over and over again. Furthermore, there is available more options in Account Settings to see overall information about profile, see the reply from Admin and change password and username. Feedback is active listening, taking time to analyze, and then finding the best solution for better performance. It provides positive criticism and allows you to see what everyone can change to improve their focus and results. With this in mind, the site allows the administrator to reach out and leave feedback, after which the user can check the response under Profile > Inbox/Messages. Furthermore, admin can manage data and upload books manually to a website.
